# Overview

Demonstrating what I have learned about the c++ language by recreating the game Battleship in the terminal

The software utilizes one array to keep track of enemy ships, and another array
to keep track of where the player has fired already. Ships are placed randomly on the board each game.

I developed this software to challenge myself to utilize what I've learned in C++ so far.
